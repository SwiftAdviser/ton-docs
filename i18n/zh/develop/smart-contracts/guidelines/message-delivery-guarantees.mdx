# Message Delivery Guarantees

TON is an asynchronous blockchain with a complex structure very different from other blockchains. Because of this, new developers often have questions about low-level things in TON. In this article, we will have a look at one of these related to message delivery.

## What is a message?

If we look at Ethereum or almost any other synchronous blockchain, each transaction can contain several smart contract calls in it. For example, DEXs perform multiple exchanges in one transaction if there is no liquidity for the selected trading pair.

In an asynchronous system you can't get a response from the destination smart contract in the same transaction. A contract call may take a few blocks to be processed, depending on the length of the route between source and destination.

To achieve the infinite sharding paradigm, it is necessary to ensure full parallelization, which means that the execution of each transactions is independent of every other. Therefore, instead of transactions which affect and change the state of many contracts at one time, each transaction in TON is only executed on a single smart contract and smart contracts communicate through messages. That way, smart contracts can only interact with each other by calling their functions with special messages and getting a response to them via other messages later.

If a transaction in Ethereum is just a set of function calls in different contracts, a transaction in TON is made up of the inbound message which initially triggered it and a set of outbound messages which are sent to other contracts.

## What is a Logical time?

In such a system with asynchronous and parallel smart contract calls, it can be hard to define the order of actions to process. That's why each message in TON has it's _Logical time_ or _Lamport time_ (later just _lt_). It is used to understand which event caused another and what a validator needs to process first.

It is strictly guaranteed that the transaction resulting from a message will have a _lt_ greater than the _lt_ of the message. Likewise, the _lt_ of a message sent in some transaction is strictly greater than the _lt_ of the transaction that caused it. As well as this, messages that were sent from one account and transactions which happened on one account are strictly ordered as well. Thanks to this, for every account we always know the order of transactions, received messages and sent messages.

Moreover, if account _A_ sent two messages to account _B_, it is guaranteed that the message with a lower _lt_ will be processed earlier. Otherwise, an attempt to synchronize delivery would require the state of all the others to be known before processing one shard, thereby breaking parallelization and destroying efficient sharding.


For each block, we can define the _lt_ span as starting from the first transaction and ending with the _lt_ of the last event in the block (message or transaction). Blocks are ordered the same way as other events in TON and so if one block depends on the other, it has a higher _lt_. The child block in a shard has a higher _lt_ than its parent. A masterchain block's _lt_ is higher that the _lts_ of shard blocks that it lists, since a master block depends on listed shard blocks. Each shard block contains an ordered reference to the latest (at the moment of shard block creation) master block and thus the shard block _lt_ is higher than the referenced master block _lt_.

## Message delivery

Fortunately, TON works in such a way that any internal message will definitely be received by the destination account. A message cannot be lost anywhere between the source and its destination. External messages are a little bit different since their acceptance to the block is at the validator's discretion however, once the message is accepted into the incoming message queue, it will be delivered.

### Delivery order

It therefore seems like _lt_ solves the issue about message delivery order, because we know that a transaction with a lower _lt_ will be processed first. But this doesn't work in every scenario.

Suppose that there are two contracts - _A_ and _B_. _A_ receives an external message which triggers it to send two internal messages to _B_, let's call these messages _1_ and _2_. In this simple case, we can be 100% sure that _1_ will be processed by _B_ before _2_ because it has a lower _lt_.

But this is just a simple case when we only have two contracts. How does our system works with more than two?

### Several smart contracts

Suppose that we have three contracts - _A_, _B_ and _C_. In a transaction, _A_ sends two internal messages _1_ and _2_: one to _B_ and another to _C_. Even though they were created in an exact order (_1_, then _2_), we can't be sure that _1_ will be processed before _2_. This is the case because routes from _A_ to _B_ and from _A_ to _C_ can differ in length and validator sets. If these contracts are in different shard chains, one of the messages may require several blocks to reach the destination contract.

The same thing happens in the reverse case, when two contracts _B_ and _C_ send a message to one contract _A_. Even if message `B -> A` was sent before `C -> A`, we can't know which one of them will be delivered first. The `B -> A` route may require more shard chain hops.

### Chains of messages

Even more interesting things can happen when we have chains of messages. Let's take a look at a few examples.

Suppose that we have contracts _A_, _B_ and _C_. In a transaction, _A_ sends two internal messages _1_ and _2_: one to _B_ and one to _C_. And after receiving _1_, contract _B_ also sends a message _3_ to _C_. In this case we can be 100% sure that message _2_ will be delivered before message _3_, because the path `A -> C` is shorter than `A -> B -> C`.

<ConceptImage src="/img/docs/msg-delivery-4.png" />

The next example is similar to what was described in Several smart contracts. Let's say that we have contracts _A_, _B_, _C_ and _D_. In some transaction, _A_ sends an internal message _1_ to _B_ and an internal message _2_ to _C_. Both _B_ and _C_ will send a message (_3_ and _4_) to _D_ after receiving a message from _A_. In this case, we also can't be sure which message, _3_ or _4_, will be delivered first.

<ConceptImage src="/img/docs/msg-delivery-5.png" />

And the most complicated example is shown in the image below. In this case, we also can't say which message will be delivered to _C_ first. Yes, the chances of message _2_ being faster than _5_ are obviously higher, but still not 100%.

## Conclusion

TON is a very fast and scalable blockchain, but the price for it is that a developer must be more careful and accurate when creating smart contracts. If the logic of the contract depends on the order in which messages are processed, the developer needs to carefully examine the guarantees that TON provides and make sure that the desired order is maintained even when the contracts are in different shards or workchains.
