# TON Connect for Security

TON Connect ensures that user has explicit control over the data they share, data does not leak in-between apps and wallets, and wallets offer strong cryptographic authentication to the apps.

## User data and funds security

- Users’ data is end-to-end encrypted when transmitted through the bridge to the wallet. This allows wallets and apps use third-party bridge servers without worrying about data integrity and safety.
- User is authenticated with their wallet address. Users may use multiple wallets and can choose explicitly which one they are using with any particular app.
- Protocol allows requesting personal data items (contact details, KYC info etc.) — the user explicitly confirms sharing of such data.

You can find more details and code examples on [TON Connect Github](https://github.com/ton-connect/).
