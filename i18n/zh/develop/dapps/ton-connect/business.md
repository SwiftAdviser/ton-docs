## Adopting TON Connect

### Basic steps

Implement TON Connect in your application using the SDK. The implementation requires minimal efforts, and can be performed by your app’s developer. The standard and documentation is available openly.

Users launch your app and connect it to one of the wallets that support TON Connect via QR code and or a universal link. Apps could also be opened within a wallet in a built-in browser.

Keep your up to date with future features in TON Connect.

### Common implementation cases

In this [SDK](https://github.com/ton-connect/sdk) you can find detailed instructions to implement TON Connect.

Provided functionality allows:

- connect to your application with a TON wallet,
- log in to your backend using the wallet's address,
- send transactions and then sign any actions with the wallet.

SDK, specifications and a demo app are available on Github: [https://github.com/ton-connect/](https://github.com/ton-connect/demo-dapp)​

### Currently supported technology stack:

- any web applications — serverless and backends;
- React-Native mobile apps;
- coming soon: SDK for mobile applications in Swift, Java, Kotlin.

TON Connect is an open protocol. You can implement and use it to develop dapps in any environment and with any programming language.

For JavaScript applications, we have made a JS SDK that implements the protocol and allows you to integrate TON Connect in minutes. SDKs for other popular programming languages will be available in the future.
